In Mexico, Baja California (B.C.) is the region with the highest production of V. vinifera L. grapes for industrial purposes. Recently, the diversity of viruses infecting insects only (insect-specific viruses) has been broadly explored to elucidate further ecological viral-host interactions in many insect species, which in some cases has resulted in the application of virus-based biological control agents for insect pests. However, a survey of the Pl. ficus virome has not been done yet. In the present study, we pooled Pl. ficus individuals collected through different vineyards of Ensenada, B.C., Mexico and analysed them by meta-transcriptomics. Novel nearly complete genomes of five RNA viruses were retrieved. These viruses were related to the Iflaviridae and Reoviridae families, and to the Picornavirales and Tolivirales orders. A new isolate belonging to the Dicistroviridae family was also found. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these putative viral genomes group with viruses having hemipteran (including a mealybug species) or other insect hosts, or with viruses associated with insects. Our results suggest that the identified novel RNA viruses could be insect-specific viruses of Pl. ficus. This work is the first insight into the Pl. ficus virome; it guarantees further studies aimed to characterize those viruses with potential for application in biological control of this economically important insect.","tags":[],"title":"Novel viral RNA genomes of the vine mealybug Planococcus ficus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

Also, a hydrocarbon concentration-related pattern was identified in ROS regulation, with a gene expression ratio near 1.8:1 between 200 and 100 μg/L treatments. Statistical analysis showed no interaction effect for metabolic rate; however, significant differences were found for oil concentration and time factors, with a higher oxygen consumption at 200 μg/L.

The distribution patterns and diversity of zooplankton provide key information for understanding the functioning of these ecosystems. Nevertheless, due to the numerous cryptic and sibling species and the lack of diagnostic characteristics for early developmental stages, the identification of the global-to-local patterns of zooplankton biodiversity and biogeography remains challenging in different research fields. The spatial and temporal changes in the zooplankton community in the open waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico were assessed using metabarcoding analysis of the V9 region of 18S rRNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI). Additionally, a multiscale analysis was implemented to evaluate which environmental predictors may explain the variability in the structure of the zooplankton community. Our findings suggest that the synergistic effects of dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, and longitude (intended as a proxy for still unidentified predictors) may explain both spatial and temporal zooplankton variability even with low contribution. Furthermore, the zooplankton distribution probably reflects the coexistence of three heterogeneous ecoregions and a bio-physical partitioning of the studied area. Finally, some taxa were either exclusive or predominant with either 18S or COI markers. This may suggest that comprehensive assessments of the zooplankton community may be more accurately met by the use of multilocus approaches. © 2021 John Wiley \u0026 Sons Ltd","tags":[],"title":"Environmental conditions drive zooplankton community structure in the epipelagic oceanic water of the southern Gulf of Mexico: A molecular approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.A. Martinez","C.M.

Here, we present a taxonomically comprehensive description of the zooplankton community (0-200 m) based on metabarcoding of the V9 hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene of 47 samples collected in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) during summer 2015. Fourteen phyla were identified Arthropoda were dominant, with Calanidae, Metridinidae, and Euphausiidae as the most conspicuous families. Other abundant phyla were Cnidaria (Hydrozoa), Chordata (Tunicata), and Chaetognatha. The V9-18S sequence data were clustered into 1888 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), of which 39 were cosmopolitan and belonging to various phyla, suggesting the presence of a core community with high local diversity throughout the GoM. Evaluation of metabarcoding sequences abundance showed overall positive correlations with morphologically quantified abundances except for specific groups. Cluster analysis of OTU distributions indicated two primary biographically distinctive groups of stations: one restricted to the Bay of Campeche, while the other occurred in the Central-West GoM, similar to previous descriptions of regional variation of the GoM based on environmental variables. Together these results provide a foundation for broad-scale zooplankton molecular biodiversity assessments in the southern GoM allowing evaluation of the effects of environmental changes on zooplankton communities. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.

As wild populations are currently depleted, abalone farm production aims to balance the decreasing populations with the increasing demand. The Mexican abalone aquaculture is almost entirely based on red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). However, the increasing frequency of extreme temperature events is hampering this activity. The use interspecific hybrids can potentially improve abalone culture, as species have differences in their thermal tolerance. Therefore, the hybrid progeny between H. rufescens (♀) and pink abalone H. corrugata (♂), a temperate and a warmer water abalone species, respectively, will naturally support higher temperature. To test this hypothesis, growth rate, mortality and metabolic rate of both pure (RR) and hybrid abalone (RP) were assessed under the H. rufescens’ optimum (18 °C) and thermally stressed (22 °C) conditions. To unveil the molecular pathways involved in the heat response, transcriptional profiling of both crosses was also investigated. At high temperature, we observed constrained growth and survival in RR while RP showed a significant increase in both rates, supporting the improved performance of the hybrid compared. These results match with the transcriptional profiling of hybrids showing higher expression of genes involved in growth and calcification, whereas in the pure red progeny, the transcriptional profile was mainly associated with the regulation of necroptosis process. Our results may contribute to propose new management plans to increase farm abalone production in Baja California. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","tags":[],"title":"Growth Performance and Transcriptomic Response of Warm-Acclimated Hybrid Abalone Haliotis rufescens (♀) × H. corrugata (♂)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Due to the rise in fishmeal (FM) price, efforts have been and still are made to replace it partially or entirely with vegetable meals in diets for carnivorous fish. The use of prebiotics when feeding vegetable meals has improved fish health. Methods: Four experimental diets were assessed in juveniles, the control diet consisted of FM as the main protein source, the second diet included 2% of GroBiotic®-A (FM-P), in the third diet FM was partially replaced (25%) by soybean meal (SM25), and the fourth consisted of SM25 with 2% of GroBiotic®-A (SM25-P). Growth was evaluated and RNA-seq of the liver tissue was performed, including differential expression analysis and functional annotation to identify genes affected by the diets. Results: Growth was not affected by this level of FM replacement, but it was improved by prebiotics. Annotation was achieved for 59,027 transcripts. Gene expression was affected by the factors: 225 transcripts due to FM replacement, 242 due to prebiotics inclusion, and 62 due to the interaction of factors. The SM25-P diet showed the least amount of differentially expressed genes against the control diet. Conclusion: The replacement of FM (25%) by soybean meal combined with prebiotics (2%) represents a good cost-benefit balance for S. lalandi juveniles since the fish growth increased and important metabolic and immune system genes in the liver were upregulated with this diet. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","tags":[],"title":"Transcriptomic assessment of dietary fishmeal partial replacement by soybean meal and prebiotics inclusion in the liver of juvenile Pacific yellowtail (Seriola lalandi)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.K.

The present study was designed to know how temperature modulates the energy physiology of O. maya adults. It was evaluated through the relationship between temperature, respiratory metabolism (measured as thermal metabolic scope: TMS), antioxidant defence mechanisms (ANTIOX) and oxidative damage indicators (ODI). Groups of males and females of O. maya were individually distributed at 24℃, 26℃ and 30℃. TMS resulted lower in animals acclimated to 30℃. Also, higher values of ANTIOX and ODI were registered in the branchial hearts in octopus acclimated to 30℃. Results demonstrate that 30℃ is a temperature that limits the energy production in O. maya, probably because of the incapacity of animals to transport oxygen to mitochondria. Although the animals are adapted to satisfy their basic energy requirements at 30℃, we hypothesize that it is not enough to cover all the energy demands needed for reproduction. At 30℃, joint with a reduction on physiologically available energy a high level of oxidative stress was observed, both explaining the previously reported reduction in the production of eggs, in the production of viable sperm and therefore in the quality of the progeny. © 2021 John Wiley \u0026 Sons Ltd","tags":[],"title":"Why high temperatures limit reproduction in cephalopods?

Assuming that most scleractinians are incapable of genetic adaptation to rapid global changes, the alternative response would be phenotypic plasticity, which is classically described as accli-matization. With the purpose of establishing a baseline for the study of acclimatization in corals of the Pacific coast of Mexico, we assessed the molecular and physiological response of 36 colonies of 3 Pocillopora morphospecies (Pocillopora cf. capitata, Pocillopora cf. damicornis, and Pocillopora cf. verrucosa) located at 2 sites (east and west) on Carrizales Reef. Our results show higher incidence of light and chlorophyll concentrations in seawater samples from the west side, suggesting the presence of at least 2 microenvironments with more and less light in the reef. In response, coral morphospecies from the west side showed higher gene expression and significant differences in pigment concentra-tions, endosymbiont densities, and metabolic markers (RNA, DNA, and proteins). Given the present concern about the future of coral reefs, we consider that the present study could be used as a baseline for the study of the physiological and molecular plasticity of Pocillopora corals in Mexican waters, so conservation strategies could be developed for key morphospecies in coral reefs on the Pacific coast of Mexico. © 2020, Universidad Autonoma de Baja California.

The distribution of lanternfish (Myctophidae) has been described based on the morphological identification of adult stages.

In this study, larvae were collected and morphologically identified as Diaphus mollis, Hygophum hygomii, H. reinhardtii, H. taaningi, Myctophum obtusirostre and M. selenops. The DNA barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) was determined for all larvae. The COI sequences matched reference barcodes available in GenBank for 14 of the identified larvae. The remaining COI sequences matched reference barcodes for different species of Myctophidae including Centrobranchus nigroocellatus, Diogenichthys atlanticus and Lepidophanes guentheri.

Its glandular appearance and its lobular morphology suggest that different parts of the WB may perform different functions, but a detailed functional analysis of the octopus WB is lacking. The aim of this study is to describe the transcriptomic profile of WB to better understand its functions, with emphasis on the difference between sexes during reproductive events. Then, validation via qPCR was performed using different tissues to find out tissue-specific transcripts. High differentiation in signaling pathways was observed in the comparison of female and male transcriptomic profiles. For instance, the expression of genes involved in the androgen receptor-signaling pathway were detected only in males, whereas estrogen receptor showed higher expression in females. Highly expressed genes in males enriched oxidation-reduction and apoptotic processes, which are related to the immune response. On the other hand, expression of genes involved in replicative senescence and the response to cortisol were only detected in females. Moreover, the transcripts with higher expression in females enriched a wide variety of signaling pathways mediated by molecules like neuropeptides, integrins, MAPKs and receptors like TNF and Toll-like. In addition, these putative neuropeptide transcripts, showed higher expression in females’ WB and were not detected in other analyzed tissues. These results suggest that the differentiation in signaling pathways in white bodies of O. maya influences the physiological dimorphism between females and males during the reproductive phase. © 2019 Juárez et al.

High temperatures (28–30 °C) negatively affect the growth and health of male O. maya. In octopuses maintained at 30 °C, as a consequence of the thermal stress we observed an increment in the haemocytes number, a reduction in the oxygen consumption rate, and an inflammatory process in the testis. The number of spermatozoa per spermatophore was not affected by temperature, but higher spermatophores production was observed at 30 °C. The paternity analysis showed that the offspring had multiple paternity with an average of 10 males contributing in a single spawn. The paternal contribution was affected by temperature with high, medium, or no paternal contribution in animals maintained at 24 °C (control group), 28 °C and 30 °C, respectively. The temperatures from 28 °C to 30 °C deeply affected the reproductive performance of Octopus maya males, suggesting that, as embryos, reproductive performance of adult males of this octopus species can be used as a tool for monitoring thermal changes in Yucatán Peninsula, located at the entrance of Gulf of Mexico. © 2018","tags":[],"title":"Reproductive performance of Octopus maya males conditioned by thermal stress","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Studies in O. maya females show that temperatures above 27◦C reduce the number of eggs per spawn, fertilization rate and the viability of embryos. High temperatures also reduce the male reproductive performance and success. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unknown. The transcriptomic profiles of testes from thermally stressed (30◦C) and not stressed (24◦C) adult male octopuses were compared, before and after mating to understand the molecular bases involved in the low reproductive performance at high temperature. The testis paired-end cDNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Then, the transcriptome was assembled de novo using Trinity software. A total of 53,214,611 high-quality paired reads were used to reconstruct 85,249 transcripts and 77,661 unigenes with an N50 of 889 bp length. Later, 13,154 transcripts were annotated implementing Blastx searches in the UniProt database. Differential expression analysis revealed 1,881 transcripts with significant difference among treatments. Functional annotation and pathway mapping of differential expressed transcripts revealed significant enrichment for biological processes involved in spermatogenesis, gamete generation, germ cell development, spermatid development and differentiation, response to stress, inflammatory response and apoptosis. Remarkably, the transcripts encoding genes such as ZMYND15, KLHL10, TDRD1, TSSK2 and DNAJB13, which are linked to male infertility in other species, were differentially expressed among the treatments. The expression levels of these key genes, involved in sperm motility and spermatogenesis were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The results suggest that the reduction in male fertility at high temperature can be related to alterations in spermatozoa development and motility.

To have a better understanding of its effects on marine invertebrates, Crassostrea virginica was exposed to different concentrations (50, 100 and 200 μg/L) of a mixture of super-light and light crude oil for two weeks, evaluating the transcriptomic response of the digestive gland using RNA-Seq and their accumulation in soft tissues. A total of 33,469,374 reads were assembled, which resulted in 61,356 genome assemblies (‘Genes’). Trinotate was used for transcript annotation. At the end of this process, 86,409 transcripts were maintained, comprising a broad set of enzymes from xenobiotics metabolism, oxidative stress, stress and immune responses, and energetic metabolism. The enrichment analysis revealed a change in biological processes and molecular functions, finding from 100 to 200 μg/L. Moreover, the differential gene expression analysis showed a dose-dependent transcriptional response, generally up to 100 μg/L and in some cases up to 200 μg/L, which suggested that oysters' response decreased after 100 μg/L; the analysis of crude oil presence in soft tissues indicated that C. virginica is a suitable candidate for ecotoxicology. Finally, these results should contribute to expanding current genomic resources for C. virginica.

Nevertheless, monitoring these toxins in shellfish is essential because they can interfere with detection by mouse bioassay of lipophilic regulated toxins. Todos Santos Bay (TSB), in the northwest of the Baja California Peninsula, is an important shellfish cultivation and fish-farming area in Mexico. The toxin analog 13-desmethyl spirolide C has been reported in cultivated mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from TSB, but the causative species associated with accumulation of this toxin has not been previously identified. We assessed the occurrence of Alexandrium ostenfeldii, the unique known producer of spirolides, by inverted light microscopy and by PCR with species-specific oligonucleotides designed for the ITS and 18S rDNA. We determined the presence and abundance of this species at the surface and at the thermocline from samples collected over two annual sampling periods (2013-2014 and 2016-2017). During the 2013-2014 period, A. ostenfeldii was found in 50% of the samples analyzed by light microscopy. The highest cell abundance (about 3.6 × 103 cells L-1) occurred in October 2013. During 2016-2017 the dinoflagellate was present in low cell abundances ( \u0026lt; 5 × 102 cells L-1) and was detected in only 20.9% of the samples. Cells of this species were usually found when sea surface temperature ranged from 17 to 20°C. We also evaluated spirolide accumulated in cultivated mussels from TSB by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The only spirolide detected was 13-desmethyl spirolide C, found mainly during the 2013-2014 sampling period, with the highest concentration (1.05 μg kg-1) in June 2014. During winter, toxin concentration was at or below the detection limit. During 2016-2017, spirolides were below the detection limit, coinciding with the absence of the causative species. Cell abundance of A. ostenfeldii and spirolide concentration in mussels did not present a clear correlation. This study represents the first record of A. ostenfeldii in TSB and provides evidence that this species is the primary origin of spirolides accumulated in mussels. © 2018 Paredes-Banda, García-Mendoza, Ponce-Rivas, Blanco, Almazán-Becerril, Galindo-Sánchez and Cembella.","tags":[],"title":"Association of the toxigenic dinoflagellate Alexandrium ostenfeldii with spirolide accumulation in cultured mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from Northwest Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.E.

Recent studies about the wild population of this species, have contributed to understand that population variations and dynamics are highly influenced by temperature. The distribution area of this species could be divided in two well-differentiated thermal zones: an eastern zone influenced by the upwelling pulses, and a western zone with no upwelling influence. There is evidence suggesting that variations in population parameters could be linked to these thermal zones. However the fishery is still managed as one single unit, and there is no control of the capture limit. In this study we analyzed the multilocus microsatellite genotypes of wild O. maya across its distribution area to find out if the population is structured, and if the structure matches the mentioned thermal zones. Additionally, the heterozygosity was compared between samples from 2010 and 2015 to monitor changes related to the high fishing pressure. Results show that O. maya population is structured in two clusters that match with the different thermal zones in the distribution area. Moreover, significant genic differentiation was detected between these thermal zones. On the other hand, despite the high fishing pressure over this species, there is no significant difference in heterozygosity between 2010 and 2015 samples, and no inbreeding was detected, showing that genetic diversity is still high. We recommend the continuous monitoring of heterozygosity in this species, and a separate fishery management for Campeche (western) and Yucatan (eastern) subpopulations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","tags":[],"title":"Genetic monitoring of the Mexican four-eyed octopus Octopus maya population: New insights and perspectives for the fishery management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

SxtA is the initial gene in the biosynthesis of saxitoxin. It has been proposed that the genes for STX biosynthesis had a bacterial origin and were acquired in the dinoflagellates by a horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In Gymnodinium catenatum, the origin of the STX genes is not well established. In this paper, we sequenced sxtA gene (domains sxtA1 and sxtA4) and determined the gene copy number in the genome in four Mexican strains of G. catenatum. We compare them with sequences of G. catenatum, Pyrodinium bahamense, and Alexandrium spp. from other geographic regions, and non-toxic producing dinoflagellates. Amplifications were performed for domains sxtA1 and sxtA4 from strains of G. catenatum and the phylogenetic analyses was done by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The copy number determination was carried out using qPCR. The phylogenetic tree of domain sxtA4 showed the formation of two clades where G. catenatum sequences separated from the Alexandrium/Pyrodinium clade. The domain sxtA1 formed a higher number of clades than sxtA4. Sequences of G. catenatum were grouped together with sequences of Alexandrium. Dinoflagellates sequences that do not produce saxitoxin formed a separate clade. The gene copy number was 64 ± 30 and 110 ± 50 copies of sxtA1 and sxtA4 respectively. The identification of the gene sxtA of G. catenatum shows that the sequences are similar to those of Alexandrium species with low variations between species. These results may indicate that the acquisition of the gene sxtA was an early HGT event in the evolution of dinoflagellates. The possible loss of the ability to produce STX in some species suggests that the HGT from Alexandrium species toward G. catenatum is not possible. © 2018 Mendoza-Flores, Leyva-Valencia, Band-Schmidt, Galindo-Sánchez and Bustillos-Guzmán.","tags":[],"title":"Identification of the Gene sxtA (Domains sxtA1 and sxtA4) in Mexican strains of Gymnodinium catenatum (Dinophyceae) and their evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.E.

A new record of this species in shallower waters suggests that it can tolerate a warmer environment than previously thought. To better understand the whole-body and molecular response mechanisms to different temperatures, we assessed the metabolic rate of juvenile individuals exposed to chronic and acute thermal conditions and analyzed the transcriptomic response in ctenidial tissues. Whole-body metabolic rate measurements showed that juveniles were able to acclimate at least partially within three weeks from 20 °C (C20) to 29 °C (C29), while organisms acutely exposed to 29 °C (A29) significantly increased their metabolic rate. This was coincident with transcriptomic results, as similar gene expression patterns were found in clams chronically exposed to C29 and C20, but different from those acutely exposed to 29 °C (A29) and 31 °C (A31). High degree of expression of genes involved in DNA repair and transcription regulation were found in C29 juveniles, whereas protective genes against oxidative stress were highly expressed in A29 organisms. A high expression of genes involved in protein re-folding was also observed in A31 juveniles. In conclusion, the combined results of whole-body metabolism and transcriptomic expression patterns suggest that P. globosa juveniles have a high physiological plasticity and are well adapted to inhabit an environment with broad temperature fluctuations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","tags":[],"title":"Transcriptomic and metabolic response to chronic and acute thermal exposure of juvenile geoduck clams Panopea globosa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

Even though spawning generally occurs at relatively stable environments, eggs and embryos can be exposed over short periods of time to high temperature anomalies caused by oceanic warming. Therefore, in this study we examined the effects of increasing temperatures on growth, respiratory metabolism, and antioxidant defense mechanisms to define the thermal limits of Octopus maya embryos in a changing environment. Ramp temperatures consisted in increments of 1 °C every 5 days from 24 °C to 30 °C. The thermal limit of embryos at ramp temperatures was detected at 27 °C with metabolic rate increments between 63% and 69%, compared with the metabolic rate observed at control temperature (24 °C). Based on the calculated integrated biomarker response (IBR) was possible to detect that at the thermal limit, an increment on oxygen consumption was observed joint with reactive oxygen species (ROS). The IBR analysis indicated that above 27 °C embryos experienced changes in the oxidative system and were not able to recover. This study suggests that in a scenario of rapidly increasing temperatures after a short winter, O. maya embryos may suffer irreversible effects that are likely to negatively affect recruitment and the population dynamic. The thermal sensitivity of O. maya embryos, revealed in the present work, indicates that this species has an important potential for biomonitoring of the effects of environmental warming. Changes in the population dynamics of this species should be further studied since they can be used as a proxy for warming of the southern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","tags":[],"title":"Thermal sensitivity of O. maya embryos as a tool for monitoring the effects of environmental warming in the Southern of Gulf of Mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

In order to further investigate the genes involved in Litopenaeus vannamei reproduction, cDNA and SSH libraries derived from female eyestalk and gonad were produced, allowing the identification of expressed sequences tags (ESTs) that potentially have a role in the regulation of gonadal maturation. In the present study, different transcripts involved in reproduction were identified and a number of them were characterized as full-length. These transcripts were evaluated in males and females in order to establish their tissue expression profiles during developmental stages (juvenile, subadult and adult), and in the case of females, their possible association with gonad maturation was assessed through expression analysis of vitellogenin. The results indicated that the expression of vitellogenin receptor (vtgr) and minichromosome maintenance (mcm) family members in the female gonad suggest an important role during previtellogenesis. Additionally, the expression profiles of genes such as famet, igfbp and gpcr in brain tissues suggest an interaction between the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) and methyl farnesoate (MF) biosynthesis for control of reproduction. Furthermore, the specific expression pattern of farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase suggests that final synthesis of MF is carried out in different target tissues, where it is regulated by esterase enzymes under a tissue-specific hormonal control. Finally, the presence of a vertebrate type steroid receptor in hepatopancreas and intestine besides being highly expressed in female gonads, suggest a role of that receptor during sexual maturation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","tags":[],"title":"Transcriptomic information from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) ovary and eyestalk, and expression patterns for genes putatively involved in the reproductive process","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"es","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"04e093914c33aabb4d5c095805e2530d","permalink":"https://genomicafuncional.cicese.mx/portfolio/external/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/portfolio/external/","section":"portfolio","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"portfolio"},{"authors":["Claudia Ventura López","ESanche","Miguel A.

Considering that temperatures in the tropics are increasing (IPCC, 2013), there are several scenarios that can modify the dynamic of the O. maya population in YP: i) prolonged summer and short winter seasons, and/or ii) fast temperature increases and high temperatures after a winter season, both affecting the survival of hatchlings and the performance of juveniles. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of maternal temperature stress over hatchling and juvenile performance in terms of their energetic plasticity and thermoregulatory behaviour, when they were exposed to a gradual temperature increase (TI) from 24 to 30. °C and compared with hatchlings maintained at preferred and constant temperature (24. °C). Hatchlings from stressed females were smaller, and had a lower growth rate compared to those from unstressed females providing evidence that temperature stress experienced by females has consequences on the performance of hatchlings, with effects on the biomass production and survival. Results also demonstrated that hatchlings exposed to TI (24-30. °C) had a growth rate and oxygen consumption similar to those maintained at preferred temperature (24. °C), in both female groups indicating that a gradual temperature increase of 1. °C every 5. days is probably enough to allow the organisms to make physiological adjustments without an excessive energetic cost. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of maternal temperature stress before spawning over the energetic balance of Octopus maya juveniles exposed to a gradual temperature change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Fungi in this group often remain latent within their host and become virulent under abiotic stress. Transcriptional regulation analysis of L. theobromae exposed to heat stress (HS) was first carried out in vitro in the presence of grapevine wood (GW) to identify potential pathogenicity genes that were later evaluated for in planta expression. Results: A total of 19,860 de novo assembled transcripts were obtained, forty-nine per cent of which showed homology to the Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, Neofusicoccum parvum or Macrophomina phaseolina. Three hundred ninety-nine have homology with genes involved in pathogenic processes and several belonged to expanded gene families in others fungal grapevine vascular pathogens. Gene expression analysis showed changes in fungal metabolism of phenolic compounds; where genes encoding for enzymes, with the ability to degrade salicylic acid (SA) and plant phenylpropanoid precursors, were up-regulated during in vitro HS response, in the presence of GW. These results suggest that the fungal L-tyrosine catabolism pathway could help the fungus to remove phenylpropanoid precursors thereby evading the host defense response. The in planta up-regulation of salicylate hydroxylase, intradiol ring cleavage dioxygenase and fumarylacetoacetase encoding genes, further supported this hypothesis. Those genes were even more up-regulated in HS-stressed plants, suggesting that fungus takes advantage of the increased phenylpropanoid precursors produced under stress. Pectate lyase was up-regulated while a putative amylase was down-regulated in planta, this could be associated with an intercellular growth strategy during the first stages of colonization. Conclusions: L. theobromae transcriptome was established and validated. Its usefulness was demonstrated through the identification of genes expressed during the infection process. Our results support the hypothesis that heat stress facilitates fungal colonization, because of the fungus ability to use the phenylpropanoid precursors and SA, both compounds known to control host defense. © 2016 The Author(s).","tags":[],"title":"Global transcriptional analysis suggests Lasiodiplodia theobromae pathogenicity factors involved in modulation of grapevine defensive response","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.L.

Evidence shows that wild females spawn when ambient natural temperatures are lower than 26. °C, caused by either the winter sea temperatures or the upwelling events. The upwelling determines the availability of cold and nutrient rich water during spring and summer in the northern side of the Yucatán Peninsula (YP). We determined the effects of ambient temperature on the reproductive performance of female O. maya maintained in thermal regimes that simulate (a) high summer temperature at the eastern side of the YP (31. °C), (b) winter temperature in all the YP (24. °C), and (c) a temperature decrease (TD) at a rate of 1. °C/5d from 31 to 24. °C. The number of spawns, eggs spawned by female, fertilization percentage, embryos development, and hatchlings survival after starvation were evaluated for each thermal regime. At 31. °C spawning of O. maya females is inhibited; only 13% spawned. The few fertilized eggs spawned died after two 2. weeks, indicating that high temperatures are deleterious to embryos. Females exposed to temperature changes of 1. °C/5 d spawned only after temperature reached below 27. °C, 87% of the females spawned. At the end TD treatment a mean value of 530 eggs per spawn was observed. Fertilization of spawns was around 50%. All the females maintained at 24. °C spawned a mean of 1208 eggs/spawn with a 70.5% fertilization rate. Embryonic development was interrupted early in TD treatments causing premature hatchlings by day 31. These premature juveniles showed smaller sizes and low survival (48%) after a 10-day fast. In contrast, embryos spawned at 24. °C exhibited larger development (45d), and hatchlings survival after a 10-day fast was 100%. Our results explain why O. maya spawns are limited to winter in the western side of the YP, when temperatures drop due to polar winds. Results also highlight the importance of the Yucatan upwelling for maintaining suitable conditions for spawning, embryo development, and hatchling survival along the year at Eastern border of the YP.

Allotriploidization of hybrid abalone has not yet been studied, and methodology useful in verifying the genotypic condition of such allotriploids do not exist. Genotypic verification of hybridization and allotriploidization in a cross of Haliotis fulgens and Haliotis rufescens was performed utilizing 6 crossamplifying microsatellite loci. Five H. rufescens spawns were used in this experiment, dividing each spawn into control and experimental hybrid groups and further into diploids and triploids. Two microsatellite loci developed for H. fulgens and H. rufescens allowed for the genotypic identification of hybrids within diploid and triploids. To further verify the percentage of allotriploids within the genotypic hybrids in the triploid hybrid groups, microsatellite loci originally developed in Haliotis corrugata and Haliotis kamtschatkana were tested for crossamplification in H. fulgens and H. rufescens. Of 21 loci, 4 were chosen for this study based on their crossamplification, heterozygosity in the females, and centromere recombination frequencies. Allotriploids in triploid-hybrid larvae were then detected by identifying larvae with recombinant genotypes at any of those loci. One family had low success verification associated with reduced recombination frequencies for all loci in that family. These results demonstrate that allotriploid verification at larval stages is feasible but depends on the number of loci available, their crossamplification in the species, and their recombination frequencies. © The American Genetic Association. 2010.

Both mitochondrial and nuclear markers showed significant differentiation among samples. Combined with previous allozyme and microsatellite data, these results indicate considerable population subdivision throughout the Gulf of Mexico, despite the potentially homogenizing effect of larval dispersal.","tags":[],"title":"Population genetics of the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica (gmelin, 1791) in the gulf of mexico","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.E.

We sampled six lagoons and analyzed variation at five microsatellite loci. Significant Hardy-Weinberg deviations occurred at all loci and were attributed to the presence of null alleles. We found no isolation by distance among the populations in these lagoons, but significant heterogeneity was observed among some adjacent lagoons, possibly reflections of geographical factors and local reductions in population size. Certain extreme north and south localities were not genetically different in terms of nonsignificant pairwise FST values. Gene flow is attributed to seasonal shifts in coastal currents, larval production throughout the year, human interference with the natural lagoon processes, and restocking efforts. The observed pattern of variation could be another example of chaotic genetic patchiness in marine organisms.","tags":[],"title":"Assessment of genetic diversity of the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica in Veracruz, Mexico using microsatellite markers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.
