Microplastic contamination is a growing problem in  coastal regions, but the impact of the ingestion and accumulation of microplastics on the physiology of marine organisms remains poorly studied.

This project uses a transcriptomic approach to evaluate gene expression profiles in the oyster _Crassostrea gigas_ by comparing a site with a higher presence of microplastics with a site with a lower concentration. Our main interest is to study the potential impacts on reproduction, immune response and detoxification capacity.
