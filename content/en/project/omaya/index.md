The Mayan octopus _Octopus maya_ is an endemic species of economic importance and with aquaculture potential. Being an ectothermic organism, temperature plays a fundamental role in its reproductive success. Therefore, this project aims to understand the role that the various glands play in the regulation of reproductive success and how temperature affects their regulation.
