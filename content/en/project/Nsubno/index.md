This project proposes an intensive, multi-scale, multi-response study of the impacts of temperature variability on the lion's pawn _Nodipecten subnodosus_, a marine ectotherm for which we have physiological and genetic information, to understand how variability shapes and limits the adaptability of populations and the phenotypic plasticity and fitness of individuals.
