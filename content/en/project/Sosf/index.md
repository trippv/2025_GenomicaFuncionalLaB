This project is being funded by the [Save Our Sears] Foundation (https://saveourseas.com/) in collaboration with the [Centro Intersciplinario de Ciencias del Mar] (https://www.cicimar.ipn.mx/) at the city of La Paz, B.C.S.

The present proposal aims to investigate the gastrointestinal microbiome in a pelagic shark and a benthic ray, contrasting a site with high levels of heavy metal contamination and two sites with low levels of anthropogenic impact along the Baja California Peninsula. The microbiome plays a fundamental role in the physiology and well-being of the host by influencing nutrient absorption, energy metabolism, regulation of reserves and enhancing protection against pathogens and environmental contaminants. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate whether the most polluted habitat induces negative alterations (dysbiosis) in the diversity of the microbiome.
