abstract = "The vine mealybug, Planococcus ficus (Signoret, 1875), is the most important insect pest in growing areas of the grapevine Vitis vinifera L. in several countries, including Mexico. In Mexico, Baja California (B.C.) is the region with the highest production of V. vinifera L. grapes for industrial purposes. Recently, the diversity of viruses infecting insects only (insect-specific viruses) has been broadly explored to elucidate further ecological viral-host interactions in many insect species, which in some cases has resulted in the application of virus-based biological control agents for insect pests. However, a survey of the Pl. ficus virome has not been done yet. In the present study, we pooled Pl. ficus individuals collected through different vineyards of Ensenada, B.C., Mexico and analysed them by meta-transcriptomics. Novel nearly complete genomes of five RNA viruses were retrieved. These viruses were related to the Iflaviridae and Reoviridae families, and to the Picornavirales and Tolivirales orders. A new isolate belonging to the Dicistroviridae family was also found. Phylogenetic analyses showed that these putative viral genomes group with viruses having hemipteran (including a mealybug species) or other insect hosts, or with viruses associated with insects. Our results suggest that the identified novel RNA viruses could be insect-specific viruses of Pl. ficus. This work is the first insight into the Pl. ficus virome; it guarantees further studies aimed to characterize those viruses with potential for application in biological control of this economically important insect Â© 2022 Microbiology Society.
