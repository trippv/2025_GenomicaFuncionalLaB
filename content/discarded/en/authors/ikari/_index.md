Shinji is a young man who was abandoned by his father Gendo, who asks him to pilot a mecha called Evangelion Unit 01 to protect the city of Tokyo-3 from Angels: creatures which threaten to destroy humanity. Shinji appears in the franchise's animated feature films and related media, video games, the original net animation Petit Eva: Evangelion@School, the Rebuild of Evangelion films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto.
