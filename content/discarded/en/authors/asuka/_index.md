Within the series, she is designated as the Second Child and the pilot of a giant mecha named Evangelion Unit 02, to fight against enemies known as Angels for the special agency Nerv. Because of childhood trauma, she has developed a competitive and outgoing character, to get noticed by other people and affirm her own self. YÅ«ko Miyamura voices Asuka in Japanese in all her animated appearances and merchandise, while in English Tiffany Grant voices her in the ADV Films dub and Stephanie McKeon voices her in the Netflix dub. She appears in the franchise's animated feature films and related media, video games, the original net animation Petit Eva: Evangelion@School, the Rebuild of Evangelion films, and the manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. In the Rebuild of Evangelion films, her Japanese surname is changed to Shikinami
